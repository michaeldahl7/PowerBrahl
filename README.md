2D Multiplayer Arena Battle Game

Built using the Unity game engine and C#.

My goal is to make a local multiplayer battle arena game to be played on a PC with xbox controllers.

Working on correctly handling multiple inputs via controllers and assigning them to the proper player.

Building the UI of the character selection screen and the logic that is involved with multiple players 
selecting a character from the same character pool.
